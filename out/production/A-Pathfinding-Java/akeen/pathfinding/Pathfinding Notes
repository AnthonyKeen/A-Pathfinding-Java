Pathfinding Notes

The Pathable Interface allows the Pathfinding algorithm to not care about the structure of the object for which it is trying to find a path. It expects that the class implementing that interface to figure out the relationships for us.

The Pathfinder class exposes only the static method findPath, everything else is used privately for its internal computation and attempt at efficiency.
The PathfindingNode class is used to augment the data that comes in with the parent reference and the f, g, and h values needed by the algorithm.

The PathfindingMain class is only used for testing to demonstrate how these classes are called.
